# itch.io Internationalization

This repository stores the internationalization project for the
[itch.io](https://itch.io) website. All source English strings and their
translations are located here. This repository also contains any scripts used
to build translations modules used by the itch.io website to insert localized
strings.

If you'd like to contribute to translations on itch.io then we recommend using
our [Weblate](https://weblate.itch.ovh/projects/itchio/). You can create an
account there and suggest translations. Accepted changes are merged back into
this branch automatically.


## Translations markup guide

itch.io uses a custom translation markup parser that powers variable
interpolations and formatting of text.

### Interpolation

Variables are inserted with the `{{ }}` syntax:

    Hello {{username}}, welcome back!

When translating strings with a variable, preserve the `{{ }}` and what is
inside. The name of the variable should give you an idea of what words will be
inserted. Use this information to place the variable in the grammatically
correct location for the translated string.

### Markup

Some translation strings contain an HTML-like markup to control formatting of
parts of the string:

    You update your password on <a>your settings page</a>.

When the translated string is displayed, the placeholder tag will be replaced
with the full markup needed for the page it appears on. In the example above,
the `<a>` placeholder will be replaced with a relevant link.

When translating strings like these, preserve the placeholder tag and what object it
wraps, but feel free to move it around to ensure grammatically correct text.

Do not add additional markup, if it isn't already in the source string then it
throw an error. These tags are not HTML, but actually work more like variables.

### HTML

All translation strings are HTML escaped when displayed, HTML markup will not
render. For example, instead of using `&mdash;` you should use the â€” character
directly.

HTML tags are not supported, only the markup syntax from the example above.

## Components

On Weblate, the translation software we use, we've split translation strings
across separate components. A component is a grouping of strings by a feature
on itch.io. This will allow translators to focus a particular part of the site
they'd like to see in their language. The `core` component represents a
critical set of strings that should be translated to enable basic usage of the
site.


## How markup works

A common problem with internationalization is how to handle strings that
contain markup. Here's an example string that needs to be made available for
translators:

    To log in, <a href="http://website" class="login_link">click here</a> and type your password

For a proper translation, the entire string must be sent as a single line of
text. An English speaker might think they can split it into three separate
strings, `To log in`, `click here`, and `and type your password`, but the
grammar of many languages requires the parts of the sentence to be in different
positions.  Additionally, a translator typically is viewing a single string at
a time. The cut up chunks give no context, which would lead to confusing the
translator and a poor translation.

So, it's necessary to include the markup in the translation string to capture
the whole sentence. In this case the translator would be expected to work
around the HTML, moving it if necessary. There are some issues with this
though:

* If the markup is complicated, then it makes it much more difficult to work with. The translator could easily make a mistake and break the functionality of the page.
* The markup is locked into the translation. If it needs to be updated later, then every translation must be edited by a programmer. 
* Putting raw HTML into the translation string means that it would be rendered in the page without HTML escaping. A XSS vulnerability may be introduced, and the risk is greater especially with crowdsourced translation. Stray characters may also break the entire page.


To solve all of these problems, a special reduced syntax is introduced:

    To log in, <a>click here</a> and type your password

It looks like HTML, but it only supports a tag names with no attributes.
Because it is a subset of HTML it's much easier to validate. It's also very
short, so it's easy for translators to work with it. Any text can be rendered
HTML escaped to prevent any invalid markup or vulnerabilities.

The `a` in this example actually references a variable named `a` in our code
where the translation is rendered. In our code we pass a function that is
responsible for rendering the full HTML tag. Here's what it looks like on our
end (in MoonScript)


```moon
@t "index.user_log_in", {
  a: (...) -> a href: @url("login"), class: "login_link", ...
}
```

All the data associated with the `a` tag is kept in our source code, and not
embedded in the translations. The attributes of the tag can be updated with a
simple change, and all existing translations will continue work.


### Optimizing the translations

Because the markup of the translation can contain more complicated syntax, I
decided to invest some time in ahead-of-time compilation to ensure translations
don't slow down the page rendering.

The simplest approach would be to fetch the string, parse it, and replace all
the interpolations during page request time. Both parsing and rendering would
require many allocations, loops, checks, and other things. What if we
*compiled* the string at build time to ensure a fast render.

Using `lpeg` we can [parse the translation string into a syntax tree](https://github.com/itchio/itchio-i18n/blob/master/helpers/compiler.moon#L10), then using
the MoonSciprt Lua compiler we can [turn that AST into Lua code](https://github.com/itchio/itchio-i18n/blob/master/helpers/compiler.moon#L40). The
translations module can be rendered with the Lua code directly inside of it
ready to be called.

Here's an example:

    To log in, <a>click here</a> and type your password


This string is parsed into the following structure:

    [
      "To log in, "
      {
        tag: "a"
        contents: [
          "click here"
        ]
      }
      " and type your password"
    ]

It's an array of chunks, where a chunk is either a string, or a object
describing the tag. The tag object contains a `contents` array that recursively
can contain strings or tags.

The next step is to turn it into Lua syntax nodes that MoonScript knows how to
compile, then compile it. The output of the compiler is this:

```lua
function(text_fn, variables)
  text_fn("To log in, ")
  variables.a("click here")
  text_fn(" and type your password")
end
```

`text_fn` is a function that is used to write text to the output buffer. In
Lapis, this is the `text` function available within a widget.

Because the function is compiled into Lua during the build step, at runtime
it's ready to be called to efficient write the translated string to the output
buffer. A [special script](https://github.com/itchio/itchio-i18n/blob/master/build_translations.moon) is used to convert all the `json` files produced by
Weblate into a single `.lua` module that can be loaded by the web app.
