# itch.io Internationalization

This repository stores the internationalization project for the
[itch.io](https://itch.io) website. All source English strings and their
translations are located here. This repository also contains any scripts used
to build translations modules used by the itch.io website to insert localized
strings.

If you'd like to contribute to translations on itch.io then we recommend using
our [Weblate](https://weblate.itch.ovh/projects/itchio/). You can create an
account there and suggest translations. Accepted changes are merged back into
this branch automatically.


## Translations markup guide

itch.io uses a custom translation markup parser that powers variable
interpolations and formatting of text.

### Interpolation

Variables are inserted with the `{{ }}` syntax:

    Hello {{username}}, welcome back!

When translating strings with a variable, preserve the `{{ }}` and what is
inside. The name of the variable should give you an idea of what words will be
inserted. Use this information to place the variable in the grammatically
correct location for the translated string.

### Markup

Some translation strings contain an HTML-like markup to control formatting of
parts of the string:

    You update your password on <a>your settings page</a>.

When the translated string is displayed, the placeholder tag will be replaced
with the full markup needed for the page it appears on. In the example above,
the `<a>` placeholder will be replaced with a relevant link.

When translating like these, preserve the placeholder tag and what object it
wraps, but feel free to move it around to ensure grammatically correct text.

Do not add additional markup if it isn't already in the source string. These
tags are not HTML, but actually work more like variables.

### HTML

All translation strings are HTML escaped when displayed, HTML markup will not
render. For example, instead of using `&mdash;` you should use the â€” character
directly.

HTML tags are not supported, only the markup syntax from the example above.

## Components

On Weblate, the translation software we use, we've split translation strings
across separate components. A component is a grouping of strings by a feature
on itch.io. This will allow translators to focus a particular part of the site
they'd like to see in their language. The `core` component represents a
critical set of strings that should be translated to enable basic usage of the
site.
